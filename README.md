# Project: Investigate a Data Set

## Introduction

This is the second project I had to complete for the Data Analytics Nanodegree on Udacity.
For this project, I had to choose a data set to analyse, and I chose the following data set [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer)
The dataset is about soccer data, which I chose because I love learning about performance.

## Main Goal

This project aims **performing a simple analysis of the dataset** and be able to answer the following questions:

- How do team results tend to differ by team overall age?
- How do team results tend to differ by team overall weight?
- How do team results tend to differ by team overall height?

## What was used

With Anaconda's help, it was used python 3.x, and jupyter.
Regarding packages, it was used pandas, numpy and matplotlib (inline)

## Other

Please, don't copy this project to conclude similar Udacity (or other platforms) courses. I hope, however, that it can help you with some insights.
